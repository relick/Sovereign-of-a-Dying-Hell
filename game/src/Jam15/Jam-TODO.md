# Saturday
1. ~~Skip reloading tiles between animations if they share a tileset (makes animations work)~~
2. Set up all the sprites
2a. Go through script and set all the poses
3. Create voting mode with basic mash gameplay, calibratable sliding meter, and influence spending
4. Add graphic for the vote bar
5. Add graphic for influence

# Code stretch
- Add sprites flying in on each mash, and 'effects' on the line
- Display text regarding influence
- Show the influence that might be gained when making a choice
- Snap transition to black at the end of a scene, and titles for each scene fading/sliding in/fading out before the overall fade in

# Sound
- Different clicks per character
- Rise then slam sound for snap transition
//not sure what else rn tbh......
