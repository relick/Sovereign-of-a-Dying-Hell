Main list of TODO:
- Software text blitting // done!
- Palette fading in RAM to allow for fading of text frame // done!
- Script engine // done!
- Character animation // done!
- Choices // done!
- Timed choices // logic done, just need graphics
- Triggered SFX // done!
- Save data (straightforward to do but just bear in mind while making script engine) // done!

Left before jam:
- Text beeps // SFXManager made, just needs to be hooked up to character and dialogue engine
- Title screen
- Character animation layering
- CG mode

Stretch:
- vpunch/hpunch
- Intro world sounds
- Credits animation
- Music room
- Better font (thicker, for better visibility on composite signal?)
- 2nd Character (portrait)

Known Bugs:
- Unresponsiveness when pressing buttons on 'blocked' frames where progression isn't allowed. Should be reasonable to just buffer the input for a few frames.
