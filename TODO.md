Objective: build a small adventure game.
Thoughts:
How does movement happen? It could be linear VN-type, it could be via explicit movement (+ map?), it could be a way to integrate a dungeon-type exploration. 

Requirements:
- Rooms with background, and interactibles able to be placed in them
- Dialogue system with full-screen character portraits
- Rooms have some kind of programmatic connection
- Flags and inventory
- Item usage
- Music and sound effects
- Map and menus

Thinking: Even that is maybe a bit much at once? I'm better off just trying to make a very simple dialogue, character and background system with music. Then it'll be a lot easier to build more into it and hopefully with more ideas.

Requirements:
- Rooms, have background + palette.
- Characters, can be half or full screen. Need to be able to change expression.
- Dialogue system, needs nice font, text box, and ability to change characters/expressions/rooms/music through the dialogue.
- Music and sound effects.
- Intro and title screen.

After all that's done, write a little script for it!

// NOTES:
Priority ordering in MD:
1. BG Colour
2. Plane B
3. Plane A
4. Sprites
5. Window Plane
6. Plane B (priority)
7. Plane A (priority)
8. Sprites (priority)
9. Window Plane (priority)

So for general VN stuff, I think it makes sense to standardise around -
Visual area:
BG = Plane B, PAL0
BG sprites = Sprites, any palette that fits
Characters = Plane A (priority). Char1 = PAL1, Char2 = PAL2. Can shift to Sprites (priority) for the sake of special animations, but this is a stretch idea
Effects/fade = Sprites (priority), PAL3. Balance with BG sprites (e.g. make them disappear during fades)

Text area:
Frame + text = Window Plane (swap priority based on effect type), PAL3 - text uses colours 0 (transparent) and 15. Will need to draw the frame that is behind the text on a different plane, most likely plane A, and use a HInt to change scroll
Effects/fade = Sprites (priority), PAL3

Doh, fades can be done with palette. ofc.




// Some new plans:
Pack bg tiles from 0 in VRAM
Pack character tiles from 1536 backwards in VRAM
Fit text tiles between tilemaps
Text frame is palette swap(s) of bg
Game blits text to tiles in RAM and DMA streams them in, allowing for non-monospace text. Idea for text is to have a larger font for names at the side of the frame (overlapping the border?) above smaller font for dialogue.

TODOs:
- Software text blitting // done!
- Palette fading in RAM to allow for fading of text frame // PAL_fade exists. lol.
- Script engine
- Character animation
- Text beeps
- Intro world sounds
- Save data (straightforward to do but just bear in mind while making script engine)
- Title screen
- Credits animation
- Music room
