Story plan

Scene: Zanmu proposes a vote to the kishin council.

Vote: [TODO: I need to think of something]
Outcome: Always fails, acts as a tutorial for voting and to demonstrate Zanmu's frustration

Scene: Zanmu talks to Hisami, who informs Zanmu of a burgeoning but secretive resistance among the heavily punished beasts of the animal realm.
Zanmu decides this is her opportunity for a power grab, and proposes a new vote for a reduction in the severity of punishment for beasts.
She decides to frame it as a matter of improving slave productivity, given the anemic economy of hell. In reality, she desires to increase the power of the beasts whilst growing their loyalty to her.

Scene: To help aid the vote, Zanmu speaks with Yuugi who is also on the council, and sympathetic to relaxing punishment in general.
Yuugi's support is easily won as long as the player appeals to her as an equal rather than moralising.

Vote: [Ending the most severe punishments of the animal realm]
Outcome: Winning this vote provides a valuable influence boost to Zanmu, but losing it does not change her plans

Scene: Suika approaches Zanmu, curious about her plans. Zanmu can choose to hide her plans from Suika, in which case all later votes require more influence and Suika leaves.
If Zanmu shares her plan, she must then play down the consequences, to dissuade Suika from actively opposing her, otherwise the same influence cost applies.

Scene: Zanmu finishes her tally of the council and feels that half are ready to follow her lead if she gives them a reason to. She decides to do this by intentionally losing a vote that should have passed. The vote will be on the increase in prices to cross the sanzu, to cover the shortfall in Hell's accounts.
She speaks again with Hisami, and can request one of the following, with the resulting outcomes:
Lobby the Yama to support the change: This increases the size of the influence gain if Zanmu succeeds in losing the vote (i.e. the favourable kishin are *extra* shocked it fails)
Sow seeds of doubt among the lesser oni: This provides an influence boost for the next vote only.
Reach out to a greater kishin for an alliance: This provides an extra option to Zanmu in the scene following the next vote.

Vote: [Increase the price to cross the Sanzu]. As Zanmu intends to lose this vote, influence is spent to vote against rather than for it.
Outcome: If the vote is lost, Zanmu gains a significant influence boost. Winning it makes it harder to dissuade Suika and persuade the beast leader.

Scene: Zanmu walks through the shadowy halls of one of hell's palaces, and hears the voice of a kishin. They are antagonistic, and attempt to threaten Zanmu with great retribution if she keeps pushing along this path. Zanmu can question the kishin to ascertain their reasons for opposing reform of hell. If she asked Hisami to reach out to a kishin to be an ally, Zanmu also gets the option to assert that she already has the votes she needs. An influence gain is possible if the shadowy kishin feels Zanmu's sea change is inevitable.

Scene: Zanmu decides to nurture the budding power of the beasts of the animal realm. She ventures there herself, and speaks with a young [beast leader].
If the anti-punishment vote passed, the leader thanks Zanmu, and she has an easier time earning influence from them.
If it failed, Zanmu can apologise to the leader, to save face.
Zanmu can broach the idea of a totally free animal realm, let go from the strangulations of the oni. Alternatively, she can simply offer advice for growing their organisation.
The leader will assert that they don't really believe Zanmu has the power to change hell so substantially. If the price increase vote passed, the leader remarks that Zanmu seems to already be able to secure votes, and wonders what Zanmu would have to gain from helping them (requiring the flattery to be perfect). If Zanmu flatters enough, she can get them to promise to back her when an important moment comes.

Scene: Zanmu speaks with the kishin council, and makes her case to create an alternative governing structure in which a subset of kishin can make decisions without the need for full council approval. This sparks much shock and discontent, but the vote is promptly held.

Vote: [Streamline decision-making by creating a small kishin executive]
Outcome: Winning this vote requires as much influence/lack of debuff as possible from earlier in the game, but doing so leads to an early ending (Ending 1)
Losing the vote causes the remainder of the game to play out.

Scene: Zanmu responds to the kishin council, declaring that if the council is run by those that refuse to face the facts of reform required, then there is no choice but to start a new hell elsewhere and leave this one to rot.

At this point, the player will need to decide on one last character to revisit to shore up their influence for the final vote.
Hisami: Hisami is very happy that Zanmu decides to spend the night before a big vote with her. This doesn't provide any benefit or detraction.
Yuugi: Yuugi is incensed by the idea of relocating hell, but Zanmu can calm her, which slightly decreases the influence required to win the final vote.
Suika: If the player already dissuaded Suika, the visit raises her suspicion and causes Suika to change her mind. Otherwise, the player gets another chance to dissuade Suika. Suika reveals that no matter how it goes, she's leaving hell anyway.
Beast leader: If the player already got their promise, this doesn't gain anything. Otherwise, they get another chance to secure the leader's promise.

Scene: Zanmu presents her remaining proposal.

Vote: [Relocate hell]
Outcome: This is the end of the game.
If the vote is won:
Zanmu is pleased, though wishes such a drastic step didn't have to be taken given the difficulty of logistics. (Ending 2)
If the vote is lost but Zanmu has the beast leader's promise:
Zanmu demands a revote, asserting that the animal realm is on the verge of change regardless of how this vote goes. If she dissuaded Suika and/or the shadowy kishin, she'll also assert that she knows most of the oni understand her proposal, demanding they act like oni and bravely support her. A revote is held with appropriate extra influence, leading to either a proper win or a loss.
If the vote is lost after a revote or without the beast leader's promise:
Zanmu laments that she must have lost her touch. (Ending 3)

Endings:
Ending 1: Zanmu leads a new executive and ushers in a firey new age of hell.
Ending 2 (leads into canon): Zanmu helps with the relocation and takes her place, removing all slavery by the oni of the animal realm which leads to the rise of the beast yakuza. Some of those that oppose her stay in former hell, with great resentment toward Zanmu for what happened.
Ending 3: Zanmu complains to herself as hell creaks on as it was.
